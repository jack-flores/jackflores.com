                    {"At "} <PageBodyLink href="https://www.as-software.com/">{"AS Software"}</PageBodyLink> {", I worked on a three-person intern team to build AS-CloudFax, a project that allows healthcare professionals to fax medical reports and images while eliminating the need for on-premises faxing hardware and server infrastructure. AS-CloudFax is cloud-native, multi-tenant, and designed to transmit PHI and PII securely."}<br/><br/>
                    {"AS-CloudFax is written with the Rust programming language using the Actix Web framework, Tokio, and SQLx with a PostgreSQL database. Through this setup, AS-CloudFax provides a reliable REST API that incorporates webhooks to deliver real-time updates. Requests to AS-CloudFax are validated for format and idempotency, and the outbox pattern is utilized to perform asynchronous actions with third-party services such as Microsoft Azure."}<br/><br/>
